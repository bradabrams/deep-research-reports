# Research Plan: GPT-5.2

## Topic Interpretation

**Subject:** GPT-5.2 is OpenAI's newest large language model, released on December 11, 2025. It represents a significant update to the GPT-5 series and was launched amid intense competition with Google's Gemini 3, following an internal "code red" directive from CEO Sam Altman.

**Key Assumptions:**
- The research will focus on the publicly released GPT-5.2 model and its three variants (Instant, Thinking, Pro)
- We will examine both the technical capabilities and the business/competitive context
- The "code red" internal memo and competitive dynamics with Google are central to the story
- Recent release means information may still be evolving; will prioritize primary sources
