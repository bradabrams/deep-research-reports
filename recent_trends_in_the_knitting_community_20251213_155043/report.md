# Recent Trends in the Knitting Community: Research Report

*Research Date: December 13, 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

The knitting and crochet community has undergone significant transformation in recent years, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, social media platforms (particularly TikTok), generational shifts, and ongoing debates about inclusivity and accessibility. This report synthesizes findings from 40 sources across market research, news media, industry publications, and community forums.

### Key Findings

**Market Growth**: The knitting and crochet market is experiencing steady growth, with the global market expected to expand by approximately $12.3 billion from 2025-2029 at a 6.9% CAGR [6]. However, specific market size estimates vary significantly across research firms.

**Pandemic Impact**: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive crafting boom, with some retailers reporting sales increases of 80-646% [4][9]. This surge brought millions of new crafters into the community, particularly younger demographics.

**Generational Shift**: TikTok has transformed knitting and crochet from stereotypically "grandma hobbies" into trendy activities among Gen Z. The #crochet hashtag has accumulated billions of views, and 86% of Gen Z identify as "hands-on creatives" [38].

**Community Tensions**: The community has experienced significant controversies including Ravelry's 2019 Trump content ban, ongoing accessibility issues from their 2020 redesign, racial reckoning discussions, and the 2022 Knitting.com debacle [25][26][13][27].

**Style Trends for 2024-2025**: European shoulder construction, texture-rich techniques (brioche, cables), chunky oversized pieces, and sustainable/upcycled materials dominate current trends [1][2].

### Confidence Assessment
- **36 claims rated HIGH confidence** (well-documented, multiple sources)
- **13 claims rated MEDIUM confidence** (single authoritative source or some variation)
- **4 claims rated LOW confidence** (unverified or unclear sourcing)
- **1 claim rated DISPUTED** (significant source disagreement)

## Findings

### 1. The Post-Pandemic Landscape

The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally reshaped the knitting community. Lion Brand, a 143-year-old yarn company, reported sales increases of 80% during lockdowns [4]. Swiss retailer Galaxus saw craft supply sales surge by 646% from April 2020 to March 2021 [4]. The Guardian reported a 140% increase in people taking up crochet in 2020 [11].

Evidence suggests the pandemic boom created lasting changes:
- Etsy more than doubled its revenues in 2020 [9]
- "We Are Knitters" saw 75% weekly sales increases during the crisis [10]
- NPD Group reported a 70% increase in arts and crafts sales in April 2020

However, the picture was nuanced. Not all retailers benefited equally—results varied by location and product mix. Some industry vendors reported doing "only 10% of the business they are accustomed to" at virtual events, and inventory shortages created supply chain challenges [9].

### 2. The TikTok Revolution and Gen Z Adoption

TikTok has been the primary driver of knitting and crochet's transformation from "grandma hobbies" to Gen Z trends. The platform's impact is substantial:

- The #crochet hashtag has accumulated between 15.5 billion and 37.3 billion views (figures vary by date and source) [11][38]
- #knittok has over 1.1 billion views [10][12]
- Crochet influencer Monet Nejon has 3.3 million TikTok followers [7]

A Mintel 2024 survey found that 86% of Gen Z consider themselves "hands-on creatives" and 30% have taken an in-person arts and crafts class [38]. Evidence suggests multiple factors drive Gen Z's embrace of yarn crafts:

1. **Mental health benefits**: Crafting provides therapeutic relief from screen-dominated lives
2. **Sustainability alignment**: Handmade clothing offers an alternative to fast fashion
3. **Aesthetic appeal**: Crochet aligns with cottagecore and grandmacore aesthetics [37][38]
4. **Accessibility**: Low barrier to entry—just a hook and yarn required
5. **Social connection**: Online communities provide belonging and inspiration

**Area of Uncertainty**: Sources disagree significantly on the percentage of young crafters. Crochet Penguin claims 73% of crocheters are ages 18-34, while Creative Industries Association data suggests only 34%. This discrepancy likely reflects different survey methodologies and populations.

### 3. Demographics: A Complex Picture

The 2024 Craft Industry Alliance Yarn Consumer Survey provides the most rigorous recent demographic data, with over 7,000 respondents [3]:

- **Average age**: 58 years (median 59)
- **Gender**: 98% female
- **Household income**: $72,000-$91,500
- **Employment**: 48% retired, 31% employed full-time
- **Craft overlap**: 84% knit, 73% crochet, 58% do both
- **Fiber preferences**: Wool most popular, followed by blended fibers, synthetic, cotton; only 2% prefer luxury yarns

However, this survey likely captures the most engaged segment of yarn consumers—those who attend industry events or follow industry channels. Other sources suggest a more even age distribution: 34% ages 18-34, 36% ages 35-54, and 30% ages 55+ [40].

One report indicates there are approximately 53 million knitters in the USA and 7.3 million in the UK, though these figures have unclear sourcing and may conflate knitting with crochet [10].

### 4. 2024-2025 Style and Technique Trends

Multiple industry sources confirm the following trends for 2024-2025 [1][2]:

**Construction & Techniques**
- **European shoulder construction**: Shoulder seam shifted toward the back, popularized by Scandinavian designers like PetiteKnit
- **Texture emphasis**: Cables, brioche, popcorn stitches, Fishermen's Rib, and bobbles
- **Chunky and oversized**: Statement pieces including oversized scarves, sweaters, and cardigans
- **Marling**: Pairing two contrasting colors for a heathered effect
- **Multi-craft combinations**: Blending knitting/crochet with appliqué, embroidery, and beadwork

**Colors**
- Pantone 2025 Color of the Year: Mocha Mousse (earthy brown)
- Blue and white combinations for colorwork
- Trending hues: sage green, terracotta, sun-washed lilac, butter yellow

**Patterns & Styles**
- Modern granny squares with geometric patterns and bold colors
- Argyle and plaid prints in fresh color palettes
- Dickies/collars replacing balaclavas as trending accessories
- Gender-inclusive patterns with broader sizing

**Key Designers**
PetiteKnit (Mette Wendelboe Okkels) has emerged as a dominant influence, with over 1 million Instagram followers [21]. Her patterns including the Lyon Sweater, No Frills Sweater, and Sunday series have shaped Scandinavian-influenced trends. Other notable Danish designers include Anne Ventzel, Lærke Bagger, and Fiber Tales.

### 5. Sustainability and the Slow Fashion Connection

The knitting community has increasingly aligned with sustainability values [1][2][19][20]:

- **Eco-friendly yarn demand**: Rising interest in organic cotton, bamboo, hemp, and recycled fibers
- **Upcycling movement**: Crafters repurposing thrifted garments and using reclaimed yarn
- **"Quiet luxury" aesthetic**: Minimalist silhouettes with premium natural fibers
- **Slow fashion philosophy**: Handmade as an opt-out from fast fashion's waste cycle

The connection between handcraft and sustainability resonates particularly with younger crafters. Making one's own garments represents a form of resistance to disposable fashion culture.

### 6. Mental Health and Wellness

Evidence suggests knitting and crochet provide mental health benefits, though claims should be viewed with appropriate nuance:

- A University of Wollongong study of 8,000 crafters found 90% reported feeling calmer and 80% reported increased happiness [10]
- 70% of new knitters cite relaxation and stress relief as their primary motivation [10]
- A 2024 University of Gothenburg study found knitting brings "a sense of calm and gives life structure" to people with mental health issues

**Important Caveat**: A 2024 systematic review of craft-based interventions noted that while "there is some evidence that crafts-based interventions may benefit mental health and well-being," more high-quality research is needed. Critics note that mental health benefits of crafting can be overgeneralized—crafting can also be "highly stressful and anxiety causing" for some people, and the assumption that knitting is "invariably calming" may be problematic.

### 7. Community Controversies and Platform Dynamics

The knitting community has experienced significant controversies that reflect broader social tensions:

#### Ravelry Trump Ban (June 2019)
Ravelry, the dominant platform with approximately 9 million registered users and 1 million monthly active users [15], banned all pro-Trump patterns and content, stating that "support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy" [25][26]. The ban:
- Made national headlines (NPR, MIT Technology Review)
- Sparked highly polarized reactions
- Led to creation of alternative platforms including Freedom Knits and Fiberkind (18,000 members) [25]
- Generated a new class of "conservative knitfluencers"

#### Ravelry Accessibility Crisis (June 2020-present)
Ravelry's website redesign caused reports of seizures (approximately 8 users), migraines, eye strain, and screen reader failures [13][14][15]. Despite introducing alternative viewing modes, the accessibility issues remain unresolved as of late 2024, with ongoing community complaints about the platform's response.

#### Racial Reckoning (2019-ongoing)
A 2019 Instagram blog post sparked a multi-year examination of racism in the knitting community [16][31]. BIPOC knitters shared experiences of discrimination at yarn shops, events, and online. Responses included:
- Creation of BIPOC in Fiber directory by Jeanette Sloan [17]
- Vogue Knitting establishing a Diversity Advisory Council (DAC)—first of its kind in the industry [23]
- The #blackpeopledoknit movement by designer Lorna Hamilton Brown [16]

#### Knitting.com Debacle (2022)
Two e-commerce entrepreneurs purchased the knitting.com domain for $80,000 and described existing businesses as "grandmas with little blogs" on their podcast [27][28][29]. The backlash was swift:
- r/craftsnark thread generated 500+ comments
- Spread to Twitter and industry blogs
- Described as "capitalism and sexism at once" by Indie Untangled
- Became a case study for online community platform revolts

#### Israel-Gaza Community Fragmentation (2024)
Controversy over a knitting influencer in Israel generated over 500 comments on r/craftsnark, with heated accusations and counter-accusations. This led to the creation of r/JewishCrafts as an alternative space where conflict discussion is explicitly off-limits [32].

### 8. Local Yarn Shop (LYS) Ecosystem

Brick-and-mortar yarn stores face ongoing challenges:

- In 2017, US yarn store count dropped below 1,000 (from 1,034 to 970)—losing 64 stores in one year [35]
- Online competition and changing shopping habits threaten traditional retail

Community support efforts include:
- **Local Yarn Store Day (LYS Day)**: Established by TNNA, the 7th annual event was held in April 2024 [36]
- Emphasis on LYS community value: supporting local taxes, donations, events, and jobs
- Growing recognition that yarn stores serve as community gathering spaces, not just retail

## Areas of Uncertainty

### Conflicting Data Points

| Topic | Conflict | Assessment |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Gen Z crafter percentage | 34% vs 73% ages 18-34 | DISPUTED - different methodologies |
| Market size | $4.7B to $18.5B | LOW confidence in specific figures |
| Total US knitters | 28.8M vs 53M | Unclear sourcing, possible conflation with crochet |
| Gender split | 71% vs 98% female | Depends on survey population (hobbyists vs engaged consumers) |
| TikTok #crochet views | 2B to 37.3B | Time-dependent; rapid growth confirmed |

### Weak Evidence Areas

1. **10% of mental health clinics integrating knitting**: Original source unclear; rated LOW confidence
2. **Specific market size projections**: Research firm methodologies vary substantially
3. **Long-term pandemic effects**: Whether craft boom represents permanent shift or temporary spike remains unclear
4. **International perspectives**: Non-US/European community dynamics underrepresented

---

## Conclusion

### What Is Established

1. **The pandemic transformed the community**: Massive influx of new crafters, particularly younger demographics, fundamentally changed community composition and dynamics

2. **TikTok drives cultural relevance**: Social media, especially TikTok, has repositioned knitting and crochet as trendy, creative pursuits rather than dated hobbies

3. **The market is growing**: Despite variation in specific figures, all sources agree the knitting and crochet market is expanding, driven by DIY trends, sustainability interest, and mental health awareness

4. **Scandinavian design dominates**: PetiteKnit and Danish designers have established aesthetic trends emphasizing clean lines, European construction, and texture

5. **Community controversies reflect broader social tensions**: Political polarization, racial equity discussions, accessibility rights, and generational/economic conflicts all manifest within the knitting community

6. **Sustainability matters**: Eco-friendly materials and slow fashion philosophy are increasingly central to community values

### What Remains Uncertain

1. **Exact market size and growth rates**: Different research methodologies produce widely varying figures

2. **True demographic composition**: Whether the community skews older (average age 58 from industry surveys) or is more evenly distributed remains unclear

3. **Permanence of Gen Z adoption**: Whether young crafters represent a lasting demographic shift or pandemic-era trend is unknown

4. **Mental health benefit magnitude**: While benefits exist, research quality is limited and effects may be overstated in popular discourse

5. **Platform future**: Ravelry's dominance despite accessibility failures, and what alternatives may emerge, remains in flux
