# Research Notes: AI Agent Frameworks

## Initial Observations (December 13, 2025)

### Framework Landscape
- Clear divide between **proprietary** (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS) and **open-source** (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen)
- Rapid consolidation happening - major launches in Sept-Oct 2025
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) emerging as potential standard from Anthropic

### Key Differentiators Identified
1. **OpenAI AgentKit**: Speed/managed infrastructure focus
2. **Anthropic Agent SDK**: Developer control/MCP protocol/security
3. **AWS Bedrock Agents**: Enterprise integration/guardrails
4. **LangChain/LangGraph**: Ecosystem breadth/community
5. **AutoGen**: Multi-agent conversations/Microsoft stack
6. **CrewAI**: Beginner-friendly/role-based agents

### Market Dynamics
- Explosive growth trajectory ($7B → $100B+ by 2032)
- Enterprise adoption accelerating (85% by end 2025)
- Security concerns are #1 blocker

### Research Gaps to Address
- [ ] Detailed technical benchmarks comparing frameworks
- [ ] Real enterprise case studies with outcomes
- [ ] Open-source vs proprietary TCO analysis
- [ ] Framework migration patterns
- [ ] Developer experience comparisons

### Terminology Notes
- "AWS AgentKit" in user query likely refers to **Amazon Bedrock Agents**
- Confirm: No AWS product specifically named "AgentKit" found
- OpenAI has "AgentKit" - may be source of confusion

### Questions for Deep Dive
1. How does MCP compare to other tool integration approaches?
2. What are actual latency/cost differences in production?
3. Which frameworks support computer use capabilities?
4. How do guardrails implementations differ?
