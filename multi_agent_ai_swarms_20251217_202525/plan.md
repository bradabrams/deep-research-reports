# Research Plan: Multi-Agent AI Swarms

## Topic Interpretation & Assumptions

### Definition
Multi-Agent AI Swarms refer to systems composed of multiple autonomous AI agents that collaborate, coordinate, and self-organize to accomplish complex tasks. These systems draw inspiration from biological swarm intelligence (ant colonies, bee hives, bird flocks) while leveraging modern AI capabilities including large language models, reinforcement learning, and distributed computing.

### Key Assumptions
1. **Scope**: This research covers both traditional multi-agent systems (MAS) and emerging LLM-based agent swarms
2. **Timeframe**: Focus on developments from 2020-present, with historical context from earlier MAS research
3. **Technical Depth**: Balanced coverage of architecture, algorithms, and practical implementations
4. **Application Domains**: Enterprise automation, scientific research, robotics, and software development
5. **Exclusions**: Single-agent systems, simple chatbot implementations, and purely theoretical swarm robotics without AI components

### Core Concepts to Explore
- Agent autonomy and decision-making
- Communication protocols between agents
- Emergent behavior and collective intelligence
- Orchestration vs. decentralized coordination
- Human-in-the-loop interactions
- Safety and alignment considerations
