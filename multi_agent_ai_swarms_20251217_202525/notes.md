# Research Notes: Multi-Agent AI Swarms

## Initial Notes
- Research initiated: December 17, 2024
- Phase: Planning complete, ready for investigation

## Key Areas to Investigate
- [ ] Framework landscape (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm)
- [ ] Academic foundations and recent papers
- [ ] Enterprise adoption and use cases
- [ ] Safety and alignment research
- [ ] Market analysis and projections

## Questions to Resolve
- What distinguishes "swarms" from "multi-agent systems" in current usage?
- How mature are production deployments?
- What are the most credible benchmarks?
