# Research Plan: Multi-Agent AI Swarms

## Topic Interpretation & Assumptions

### Definition
Multi-Agent AI Swarms refer to systems where multiple autonomous AI agents coordinate and collaborate to accomplish complex tasks, often inspired by biological swarm behaviors (e.g., ant colonies, bird flocks, bee swarms). These systems emphasize:
- **Decentralized control**: No single point of failure or central coordinator
- **Emergent behavior**: Complex outcomes arising from simple individual rules
- **Self-organization**: Agents dynamically adapting roles and behaviors
- **Collective intelligence**: Group performance exceeding individual capabilities

### Scope Assumptions
1. **Technical Focus**: Includes both traditional multi-agent systems (MAS) and modern LLM-based agent swarms
2. **Temporal Scope**: Historical foundations (1980s-2000s) through current developments (2023-2025)
3. **Application Domains**: Software development, research, robotics, business automation, scientific discovery
4. **Architecture Types**: Hierarchical, flat/democratic, hybrid, and emergent swarm structures
5. **Agent Types**: Rule-based agents, reinforcement learning agents, LLM-powered agents, and hybrid systems

### Key Distinctions
- **Multi-Agent Systems vs. Swarm Intelligence**: MAS focuses on agent interactions; swarm intelligence emphasizes emergent collective behavior
- **Orchestrated vs. Autonomous**: Some systems have explicit coordinators; others are fully decentralized
- **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous**: Agents may be identical or specialized
