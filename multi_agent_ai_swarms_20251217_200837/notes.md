# Research Notes: Multi-Agent AI Swarms

## Initial Notes

*Research initiated: 2024-12-18*

### Key Areas to Investigate
- Modern LLM-based frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm, MetaGPT)
- Classical multi-agent systems foundations
- Swarm intelligence and bio-inspired computing
- Commercial applications and market trends
- Safety and alignment considerations

### Preliminary Observations
- Field experiencing rapid growth since GPT-4 release (March 2023)
- Multiple competing frameworks with different design philosophies
- Tension between orchestrated and truly autonomous swarm approaches
- Active debate about single-agent vs. multi-agent effectiveness
