## Key Findings Summary

### Major Breakthroughs 2024-2025

#### NIF (Inertial Confinement)
- **Record Q-factor: 4.13** (8.6 MJ from 2.08 MJ laser) - highest ever achieved
- Ignition achieved **7 times** since Dec 2022 breakthrough
- **Caveat**: Full facility requires 400 MJ to operate, so practical energy gain still distant

#### China's EAST Tokamak
- **January 20, 2025**: 1,066 seconds H-mode plasma at 100M°C
- Previous record: 403 seconds (2023) - nearly 3x improvement
- Heating system power doubled since last experiments
- Next-gen "artificial sun" design completed

#### HTS Magnet Technology
- CFS/MIT 20 tesla magnet (2021) - "most important fusion development in 30 years"
- November 2024: CFS Central Solenoid Model Coil successfully tested
- 6 peer-reviewed papers published March 2024 validating technology

### ITER Status - Major Delays

| Metric | Original | Current |
|--------|----------|---------|
| First Plasma | 2025 | **2033** |
| D-T Operations | 2035 | **2039** |
| Cost | €5B | **$22B+** |

**Key Issues:**
- Thermal shield defects: ~20-23 km of cooling pipes must be replaced
- COVID-19 delays + manufacturing quality problems
- Vacuum vessel assembly halted Nov 2022 for precision issues

### Private Sector Surge

| Company | Funding | Key Milestone |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Commonwealth Fusion | ~$3B | SPARC first plasma 2026, ARC plant early 2030s |
| Helion Energy | $1B+ | Orion plant construction started July 2025 |
| TAE Technologies | $1.2B | $5B valuation, Google partnership |

**Major PPAs Signed:**
- Microsoft + Helion: 50 MW by 2028 (world's first fusion PPA)
- Google + CFS: 200 MW from ARC plant

### Investment Landscape
- **Total private investment**: $9.7B+ across ~50 projects
- **Growth**: From €1.5B (2020) to €9.9B (2025)
- **Key investors**: Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Morgan Stanley, Bill Gates (Breakthrough Energy)

### Policy Developments
- **DOE Fusion Energy Strategy 2024**: Pilot plant goal in 2030s
- **IAEA World Fusion Energy Group**: Established 2024
- **160+ fusion facilities** operational, under construction, or planned globally

## Critical Perspectives & Challenges

### Skepticism Points
1. "Fusion always 30 years away" - historical pattern of missed timelines
2. Tokamak Energy (2016): Promised energy production in 5 years - not delivered
3. General Fusion (2009): Promised prototype in decade - still pending
4. NIF practical energy: 400 MJ input for 3 MJ output

### Technical Hurdles Remaining
- Plasma stability for extended periods
- Materials that can withstand first-wall neutron bombardment
- Tritium breeding and handling at scale
- Net energy gain in magnetic confinement (no tokamak has achieved Q>1)

### Timeline Reality Check
- Expert estimate: 12-15 years to build fusion power plant
- Competition from rapidly improving renewables
- ITER delays raise questions about megaproject approach

## Questions Still to Research
- [ ] Regulatory framework developments (NRC approach)
- [ ] UK fusion program and STEP project
- [ ] Japan and South Korea programs
- [ ] Stellarator progress (Wendelstein 7-X)
- [ ] Environmental/safety comparison to fission
- [ ] LCOE projections for fusion vs other sources
- [ ] Alternative approaches (FRCs, magnetized target)

---

## Source Quality Assessment
- **HIGH confidence** (3+ corroborating sources): 16 claims
- **MEDIUM confidence** (2 sources): 6 claims
- Government/academic sources: 10
- Company press releases: 5 (treated with appropriate skepticism)
- News/analysis: 3
