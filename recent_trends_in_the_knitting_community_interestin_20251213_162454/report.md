## Executive Summary

The knitting community in 2024 is experiencing a fascinating paradox: while long-term search interest has declined 48% since its 2013 peak, a vibrant revival is underway driven by Gen Z adoption on TikTok (#KnitTok has surpassed 1.1 billion views) and high-profile celebrity endorsements like Tom Daley's viral Olympic knitting. The global knitting yarn market is valued at approximately $4.7 billion in 2024 with projected growth to $7.1 billion by 2033.

### Key Findings

**What's Hot in 2024:**
- **Blue** has replaced hot pink as the dominant color trend
- **Cardigans** (especially longer lengths) are the most popular garment type
- **Textured knitting** (Aran, brioche) and **Fair Isle colorwork** dominate technique trends
- **Sustainability** drives 58% of demand, particularly among younger knitters (ages 18-34)

**Community Dynamics:**
- Ravelry remains dominant (74% usage) but faces significant challenges after a 2020 redesign controversy
- Reddit's r/knitting community has grown to 563,000+ members
- Political tensions have created community divisions, with some knitters forming separate spaces

**Economic Realities:**
- Yarn prices rising due to raw material costs (cotton up 148% since 2020)
- Indie dyers face profitability challenges (~$2 profit per skein reported)
- 56% of consumers now buy more yarn online than in-store

### Confidence Assessment
- **25 claims** verified as HIGH confidence (3+ corroborating sources)

## Methodology & Limitations

### Sources Used
This research drew from 38 sources across multiple categories:

| Source Type | Count | Examples |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Industry Reports | 4 | Technavio, Business Research Insights, Craft Industry Alliance |
| News Media | 8 | NPR, CNN, MIT Technology Review, WWD |
| Knitting Blogs | 12 | Susanna Winter, Stitches and Cream, Young Folk Knits |
| Community/Social | 6 | Reddit, TikTok, Ravelry statistics |
| Academic | 1 | ResearchGate study on male knitters |
| Product/Brand | 7 | Knitting for Olive, Rowan, We Are Knitters |

### Research Limitations

1. **Geographic Bias**: Most available data focuses on English-speaking markets (US, UK, Australia, Canada). One survey acknowledged that over 65% of respondents came from North America, with less than 5% from outside the Western world [2].

2. **Demographic Sampling Bias**: Industry surveys tend to reach internet-connected, English-speaking knitters who engage with online platforms, potentially underrepresenting older knitters, non-English speakers, and those who knit but don't participate in online communities.

3. **Market Forecast Variability**: Different research firms provide significantly different market valuations (ranging from $4.7B to $7.2B for the 2024 yarn market), suggesting these figures should be treated as estimates rather than precise measurements.

4. **Platform Data Limitations**: TikTok and Instagram statistics are self-reported platform data, not independently audited figures.

5. **Recency of Trends**: "Trend" claims are inherently time-sensitive and may shift rapidly.

## Findings

### 1. Style & Color Trends

**Blue is the color of 2024.** Multiple sources confirm that shades of blue have replaced hot pink (2023's dominant color) as the trending choice for knitters [1][2][3]. Blue was prominent in Spring 2024 fashion shows and is frequently paired with white for colorwork designs. As one source noted, "Blue never goes out of style and is easy to style in any season" [1].

Evidence suggests cherry/crimson red, peach (Pantone's 2024 color of the year), and lavender are also trending for specific seasons [2].

**Cardigans dominate garment trends.** The cardigan has emerged as 2024's must-knit garment, appearing in multiple variations: "delicate and lacy options perfect for spring and summer layering to the timeless librarian style" [1]. Longer lengths are particularly fashionable, with sources noting "the longer the length, the better" [2].

**Nautical and preppy aesthetics** are influencing knitwear design, driven partly by Miu Miu's fashion influence. This manifests in chunky cables, bold stripes, and argyle patterns [2][7].

### 2. Technique Trends

**Fair Isle colorwork continues its multi-year dominance**, with sources confirming it "has become the favorite colorwork piece in the fashion industry this season" [1][2][3]. Large colorwork motifs are particularly popular for fall and winter designs.

**Textured knitting is a major 2024 trend.** Techniques like Aran cables and brioche stitches are in high demand, with knitters drawn to "thick, raised patterns...which add depth and a rich look" [1][2][3][24].

Evidence suggests these additional techniques are gaining popularity:
- **Marling**: Pairing two contrasting yarns for a heathered effect [2]
- **Fuzzy yarns with lace**: Creating ethereal "halo effects" with mohair or suri alpaca [2][3]
- **European Shoulder Construction**: A Scandinavian-influenced technique shifting shoulder seams toward the back [2]

### 3. Demographics & Market Size

**The knitting community is predominantly female but diversifying.** Surveys indicate 71-98% of knitters are female, with the range reflecting different methodologies [4][5][6]. The average yarn consumer age is 58 years old according to a 2024 survey of 7,000+ respondents [5].

However, age distribution data suggests broader appeal: approximately 34% of knitters are aged 18-34, 36% are 35-54, and 30% are 55+ [4][6]. Young people, particularly Gen Z, are driving growth through social media engagement.

**Evidence suggests male participation is growing.** LoveCrafts reported more than one-third of young men are taking up knitting or crochet, though this figure comes from a single company survey and may not represent the broader population [32]. Notably, men were historically the primary knitters in medieval guilds, and Men's Knitting Retreats now operate across multiple U.S. regions [32][33].

**Market valuations vary but show growth.** The global knitting yarn market is valued at approximately $4.7 billion in 2024, with projections ranging from $7.1-7.2 billion by 2033 (CAGR of 4.5%) [8][25]. The broader knitting and crochet market is projected to grow by $10.69 billion from 2024-2028 [8].

### 4. The Social Media Revolution

**#KnitTok has transformed the hobby.** The TikTok knitting community has accumulated over 1.1 billion views, with Gen Z firmly driving the revival [37]. Young "knit-fluencers" are gaining massive followings by reimagining traditional techniques with modern designs.

WWD identified knitting as a Spring 2024 TikTok trend alongside coquette bows, describing it as part of a broader movement toward "hands-on crafting activities" driven by consumers "suffering from sensory deprivation" [7].

**Tom Daley's Olympic knitting went viral in 2024.** The British diver was spotted knitting during the Paris Olympics, creating a red, white, and blue "Paris 24" sweater featuring French and British flags [28][29]. Daley described knitting as "my mindfulness, my meditation, my calm and my way to escape the stresses of everyday life" [28].

*Note: Daley's TV show "Game of Wool" later faced criticism from Scottish knitters for misrepresenting Fair Isle techniques, with an MSP formally inviting him to Shetland to learn proper terminology [28].*

**Instagram remains significant**, with over 23 million posts using #knitting [4]. Ravelry, while declining, still claims 74% usage among knitters [4].

### 5. Sustainability Movement

**Eco-consciousness is a major driver of 2024 knitting trends.** Market research indicates DIY and sustainable materials drive 58% of demand, particularly among ages 18-34 [8][9][10][11].

Recycled and sustainable yarn options are expanding rapidly:
- **Knitting for Olive No Waste Wool**: 50% recycled wool, 50% traceable non-mulesed Merino [10]
- **Rowan Cotton Revive**: Made from regenerated cotton fibers [9]
- **Berroco Seaspun**: Polyester spun from ocean-reclaimed plastic [9]
- **Plant-based alternatives**: Bamboo, hemp, and Lyocell (Tencel) gaining popularity [9]

**Patchwork-inspired knitting is making a comeback**, influenced by the upcycled fashion movement. This approach uses leftover yarn scraps, making it "both eco-friendly and budget-conscious" [1][3].

### 6. Technology & Digital Tools

**Digital tools have transformed how knitters learn and work.** Over 60% of hobbyists now rely on online tutorials, mobile apps, and e-learning platforms [8].

Popular knitting apps include:
- **KnitCompanion**: Rated 4.7/5, subscription $9.99/year, updated September 2024 [22]
- **Stitch Fiddle**: Free web-based chart maker, works across all platforms [22]
- **Knitrino**: Emerging app combining interactive patterns with tutorials and marketplace [23]
- **PatternGenius**: Vector-based pattern creation for Mac and iPad [22]

### 7. Community Dynamics & Tensions

**Ravelry remains dominant but faces significant challenges.** The platform experienced a 48% decline in engagement since its 2013 peak [26]. A controversial 2020 redesign caused an accessibility crisis, with at least eight users reporting seizures and many more experiencing migraines, vertigo, and eyestrain. A complaint thread accumulated over 7,000 replies [26].

**Political divisions have fractured the community.** Ravelry's 2019 decision to ban pro-Trump content, stating "support of the Trump administration is undeniably support for white supremacy," created lasting divisions [30][31]. Alternative platforms emerged including Fiberkind (18,000 members) and Freedom Knits [31].

More recently, post-October 7, 2023 tensions led Jewish crafters to create separate spaces like r/JewishCrafts (200+ members) where political discussion is explicitly off-limits [27].

**Reddit's r/knitting has grown to 563,000+ members**, offering a supportive environment for pattern advice, troubleshooting, and project sharing [26].

### 8. Economic Factors

**Yarn prices are rising due to raw material costs.** Cotton prices have increased dramatically from 47.55 cents/lb in April 2020 to 117.87 cents/lb in 2024—a 148% increase [14]. Australian merino wool prices have risen 56% since 2016, reaching approximately $14/kg [14].

**Indie dyers face profitability challenges.** One report indicates indie dyers make approximately $2 profit per skein, making it "nearly impossible to sell enough skeins to make a livable wage" [13]. Those successfully supporting themselves report working seven days a week without time off.

**Shopping behavior has shifted online.** 56% of yarn consumers report buying more online than in previous years, with pandemic-era shopping habits persisting [5]. However, Local Yarn Store Day (April 27, 2024) continues to support brick-and-mortar shops [19].

### 9. Size Inclusivity

**Size-inclusive patterns have become an industry expectation.** The community consensus is that patterns should extend to at least 5X or 60" bust, with some designers offering sizes up to 70" [20][21].

Notable size-inclusive designers include Jessie Maed Designs, Andrea Mowry, Tincanknits, and Kristen TenDyke [21]. Resources like Victoria Marchant Knits maintain databases of inclusive patterns searchable by yarn weight, intended gender, and other criteria [21].

### 10. Popular Patterns & Community Favorites

Ravelry project counts reveal enduring favorites:
- **Hermione's Everyday Socks**: 40,000+ projects [36]
- **Sockhead Slouch Hat**: 30,000+ projects [36]
- **Flax Sweater** (Tincanknits): ~30,000 projects [36]
- **Honey Cowl**: 28,000 projects [36]
- **Clapotis** shawl: 23,000+ projects [36]

For Fall 2024, trending new patterns include the **Ruth Pullover** by Irene Lin (free, oversized with gentle V-neck), **Lines Socks** with Dutch heel construction, and the **Alpine Journey Hat** combining cables, ribbing, and moss stitch [24].

## Areas of Uncertainty

### Conflicting Data

1. **Age Demographics**: Survey data conflicts—one survey reports average age 58, while another shows relatively even distribution across age groups (34% 18-34, 36% 35-54, 30% 55+). This likely reflects different survey populations and methodologies.

2. **Market Size**: Different research firms provide valuations ranging from $4.7B to $7.2B for the 2024 yarn market. All forecasts should be treated as estimates.

3. **"Dying Hobby" vs Revival**: Knitting appears on Ordnance Survey's "forgotten skills" list, yet market data and TikTok growth indicate revival. Both narratives have supporting evidence—long-term decline is real, but recent reversal is also documented.

### Weak Evidence Areas

1. **Male Knitter Statistics**: The claim that "1/3 of young men are taking up knitting" comes from a single company survey without detailed methodology. Treat with caution.

2. **Indie Dyer Economics**: The $2/skein profit figure is anecdotal from a single blogger source, not industry-wide data.

3. **Mental Health Benefits**: While widely claimed, the specific assertion about dopamine release requires more rigorous scientific verification than provided by available sources.

4. **Stitch 'n Bitch Revival**: Claims of "global resurgence" in knitting meetups come from limited sources and may be geographically specific.

## Conclusion

### Established Findings (HIGH Confidence)

The knitting community in 2024 shows clear, well-documented trends:

- **Blue is the dominant color**, with cardigans and textured knitting as key style trends
- **Gen Z is driving a social media revival** through TikTok (#KnitTok: 1.1B+ views)
- **Tom Daley's Olympic knitting** brought mainstream visibility to the craft
- **Sustainability matters** to younger knitters, spurring recycled yarn innovation
- **Ravelry faces challenges** after accessibility controversies, though it remains dominant
- **Size inclusivity** has become an industry standard (5X/60"+ expected)

### Areas Requiring Caution

Some popular claims have weaker evidentiary support:

- Market forecasts vary significantly between sources
- Demographic surveys have acknowledged sampling biases
- Male participation growth figures may not represent broader population
- The "knitting revival" narrative coexists with long-term decline data

### For Knitting Hobbyists

The knitting community in 2024 offers rich opportunities for engagement. Whether you're drawn to trending Fair Isle colorwork, seeking sustainable yarn options, or looking to connect via #KnitTok or local meetups, the craft continues to evolve while honoring traditional techniques. The most vibrant growth appears among younger knitters embracing the craft as both creative expression and mindful practice.
