# The Chime

**by Claudia Vance**

---

The conference room has glass walls. Maya can watch David Reese's mouth shape the words before she has to hear them.

"Efficiency initiative."

There it is. The phrase that means layoffs without saying layoffs. David Reese stands at the head of the table in a gray suit that cost more than Maya's monthly mortgage. He's not a bad man. That's almost worse. A bad man you could hate.

"The partnership has decided to implement a phased transition," he says. "Over the next eighteen months, we'll be optimizing our support staff structure."

Fourteen paralegals in this room. Maya counts heads without meaning to. Fourteen people who've been showing up, doing the work, paying their bills. David Reese is explaining that six of them will remain.

She knows she should be calculating. Who's safest? Who's fastest with the new systems? Maya has been here eighteen years. She's trained half the people in this room. But the AI doesn't care about tenure. The AI works at two in the morning without overtime. The AI never asks for health insurance for its daughter.

"We'll be offering transition packages for those who'd like to volunteer for early departure," David says. "The packages are generous. Career counseling included."

The room is silent. Maya can hear the HVAC system humming. Someone's phone buzzes and they fumble to silence it.

No one speaks.

She watches her colleagues' faces. Priya is staring at the table. Derek's leg is bouncing under it. Carmen, who's been here even longer than Maya, has her lips pressed into a thin line. They're all doing the math. Fourteen minus six is eight. Eight people in this room who will be gone.

David Reese glances at his phone. He has another meeting.

Maya hears her own voice before she realizes she's going to speak.

"What if we don't volunteer?"

The words hang in the air. David Reese looks up. He finds her in the back row—Maya Chen, paralegal, eighteen years, never makes trouble.

"I'm sorry?" he says.

"What if none of us volunteer?" Her voice is steadier than she feels. "What then?"

The silence changes texture. It was numb before. Now it's watching.

David Reese's pause stretches for two seconds, three. He's recalibrating. Maya sees him do it—the slight adjustment of his shoulders, the practiced ease returning to his face.

"Well," he says, "we'd have to proceed to involuntary transitions. I'm sure everyone would prefer to avoid that."

"Would we?"

She doesn't know why she's still talking. She should stop. She's never done this. She is forty-two years old and has kept her head down her entire career because keeping your head down is how you survive. But something is loose now, something that won't go back in the box.

"Would we prefer that?" she continues. "Or would we just prefer to pretend we have a choice?"

David Reese's smile doesn't reach his eyes. "Maya. I understand emotions are running high. Why don't we table further discussion and let everyone digest the information? My door is always open."

The meeting ends. People file out. Maya stays seated for a moment, her hands flat on the table. She feels like she's swallowed something sharp.

Priya catches her eye as she passes. A small nod. Then she's gone.

---

Her supervisor Karen asks to see her at 2:15.

The conversation lasts twelve minutes. Karen uses the words "tone" and "professional environment" and "think about what's best for your career." She doesn't threaten. She doesn't have to.

Maya returns to her desk. The notification chime sounds—the AI has finished processing the Henderson document batch. She's supposed to review it, flag any anomalies.

She opens the first document. A contract clause comparison. The AI has flagged a discrepancy in liability language between versions. Good catch, she thinks reflexively—then stops.

The AI's explanation reads: *Version 2 includes a force majeure clause that broadens the definition of 'unforeseeable circumstances' to include labor disputes.*

But that's not what the clause says. Maya reads it twice. The AI has confused "labor disputes" with "labor shortages." One word. A word that could cost a client millions in a wrongful termination suit.

She flags the error, types the correction. The system accepts it, learns from it. Every fix she makes is a lesson. Every lesson brings the day closer when it won't need her to teach it anymore.

She knows this. She's known it for two years. She used to think: if I just make myself useful enough, if I catch enough errors, they'll need me. Now she knows the truth. Her usefulness is temporary. She is training her replacement.

Around her, the fourteenth floor is quiet. The empty desks—the ones that cleared in the last round of transitions, the round that was supposed to be the last—watch her with their blank screens.

She works until 5:30. When she leaves, no one says goodbye.

---

Lily is at a friend's house. Maya picks her up at seven, drives home in the gray October evening, makes pasta because pasta is easy and she can't think.

"How was work?" Lily asks.

"Fine," Maya says.

Lily is sixteen. She knows what "fine" means. But she lets it go, scrolling through her phone while Maya stirs the sauce. The kitchen is warm. The windows are dark.

At 2 AM, Maya is still awake.

She runs scenarios. She could take the package. Six months' salary, career counseling that means nothing, time to find another job in a market where everyone with a law degree is fighting for paralegal positions. She could keep her head down, hope she's one of the six. She could start looking now, get ahead of the rush.

She could pretend this morning didn't happen.

The ceiling offers no answers. Her body is tired but her mind won't stop.

*What if we don't volunteer?*

She doesn't know who that woman was. The one who spoke. But she suspects she's going to have to find out.

---

The break room coffee is lukewarm. It's always lukewarm.

Priya finds her there at 10:15.

"Hey." Priya's voice is low. She glances around. "I wanted to say—yesterday. I'm glad you said something."

Maya wraps her hands around the paper cup. "I probably shouldn't have."

"Maybe. But I've been thinking." Priya sits down across from her. "My sister's husband works at the tech company downtown. The big one. They organized last year. Like, an actual union."

The word hangs between them.

"I don't know anything about that," Maya says.

"Neither do I. But I've been looking it up." Priya pulls out her phone. "There are resources. Templates. Other white-collar places that have done it."

Maya should say no. She should say this is a bad idea, that it'll never work, that they'll just fire anyone who tries. She should protect herself, protect Lily. She should be smart.

"Show me," she says.

---

That night, after Lily is asleep, Maya sits at the kitchen table with her laptop.

She learns about authorization cards and the NLRB. Thirty percent of workers signing cards to trigger a vote, but a majority to actually win—which means you want more than half before you even file. She reads about nurses in Texas, tech workers in Seattle, accountants in Minneapolis. Most stories end in failure. The successful ones took months.

She starts a document. Names and assessments. Who might be willing. Who's too scared. Who has nothing to lose.

The screen glows in the dark kitchen. Outside, a car passes. The house creaks in the wind.

She types until 1 AM. She doesn't know if this will work. But she's doing something, and doing something is better than lying awake running scenarios.

---

The next three weeks are quiet on the surface.

Maya does her job. She reviews documents, catches the AI's errors—not many, but enough to matter. She smiles at Karen. She keeps her head down.

Beneath the surface: conversations.

In the stairwell, Marcus tells her about his student loans, the apartment lease he just renewed, the paralysis of not knowing what comes next. "I've been looking at job boards," he says. "But everything is either entry-level or asking for skills I don't have."

At a diner after work, she sits with Priya and James. James has been updating his resume for three months. "Every posting says 'AI proficiency required,'" he says. "What does that even mean? I use the damn thing every day. But they want someone who'll use it to do my job and four other people's."

In the parking garage, Angela catches her before she gets in her car. Angela has a daughter in the same grade as Lily. "I'm scared," Angela says. Her voice is small, embarrassed. "Does that make sense? I've never been scared of losing a job before."

"It makes sense," Maya says. "I'm scared too."

Some people are interested in organizing. Some are terrified. Some are both.

They make a list. Fourteen names. Maya and Priya mark them: yes, no, maybe, unknown.

Seven yeses. Two maybes. Three nos. Two unknowns.

Close. But not enough.

---

Karen calls her in on a Thursday.

The office smells like coffee and the synthetic floral of air freshener. Karen has photos on her desk—her kids, her husband, a beach somewhere tropical.

"I wanted to check in," Karen says. "See how you're doing."

"I'm fine."

"Good. That's good." Karen folds her hands. "You know, Maya, you've been here a long time. I've always valued your work."

Here it comes.

"The partnership wants me to let you know that we're willing to extend an enhanced transition package. Given your tenure. An extra three months' salary, extended benefits, strong references. It's a good offer."

Maya's hands are cold. She puts them in her lap.

"I appreciate that."

"I just want you to think about what's best. For you. For Lily."

The sound of her daughter's name in Karen's mouth makes something clench in Maya's chest. This is a different kind of fear—not the cold dread of the announcement, not the jittery anxiety of organizing. This is the fear of being seen. Of being targeted.

"I'll think about it," Maya says.

She returns to her desk. Her hands shake for ten minutes. She hides them and reviews documents until they stop.

---

Derek takes the package on a Monday.

He doesn't say goodbye. He just isn't there—his desk clean, his chair pushed in, his nameplate gone. HR sends an email: "We wish Derek well in his future endeavors."

Maya stares at the empty space. Derek was twenty-eight. He'd come to her once, early in the organizing, and asked what she thought would happen. "I don't know," she'd told him. "But I think we have to try." He'd nodded, but his eyes had been somewhere else.

She understood. He was young enough to start over. Old enough to know it wouldn't be easy.

Now they're thirteen. Now they need seven for a majority. They have six firm yeses and one maybe.

One signature short.

---

The leak happens on a Wednesday.

Maya doesn't know who talked. Maybe it wasn't even intentional—maybe someone mentioned it to the wrong person, or left a document open, or just looked too nervous when Karen walked by.

But by Thursday morning, management knows.

They call in the maybes, one by one. "Career counseling." When Angela comes out of Karen's office, her eyes are red. She doesn't look at Maya. She goes to her desk, opens her computer, and stares at the screen without seeing it.

Maya finds Priya in the stairwell. "We're losing them."

"We have the signatures we have," Priya says. "Maybe it's enough."

"Six out of thirteen isn't a majority."

"Then we find one more."

Maya thinks of the list. Who's left. Who hasn't said no.

Carmen.

---

Carmen Reyes has been at Martin & Associates for twenty-five years. She was here when Maya started—showed her where the supply closet was, taught her the preferences of senior partners, told her which attorneys to avoid on deadline days.

She's sixty years old. Two years from retirement. Everything to lose, nothing to gain.

Maya finds her at her desk, surrounded by a quarter century of artifacts. A mug from some firm outing in 2015. A cartoon someone drew of her, yellowed at the edges. A photo of grandchildren Maya didn't know she had.

"Can we talk?" Maya asks.

Carmen looks at her for a long moment. Then she nods at the empty chair.

Maya sits. She'd prepared arguments—protection, severance, having a seat at the table. But looking at Carmen's face, the words feel inadequate.

"I need your signature. For the union petition."

"Why would I sign that?"

Maya stops. Starts again.

"I don't know if it'll work. It probably won't. But someone has to try, and the only way it works is if enough people try together." She takes a breath. "And I'm asking you."

Carmen is quiet. Outside the window, the city goes on—fourteen floors down, people walking to lunch, living lives without authorization cards or transition packages. Without the desperate hope that strangers might choose to trust each other.

"I remember when you started," Carmen says. "You were so serious. Stay late every night, checking everything three times."

Maya waits.

"I'm retiring in two years. What happens here after I leave—it won't affect me."

"I know."

"But it'll affect you. And Priya. And whoever they hire next, if they hire anyone." Carmen picks up the mug from 2015. Turns it in her hands. "This used to be a good place to work. Not perfect. But good. I've watched it change. I've watched people get scared."

She sets the mug down. Looks at Maya.

"I watched you train Elena on the new system last year. You spent three weeks with her, stayed late, helped her when she didn't catch on as fast as the others." Carmen pauses. "She was gone in the next round. Remember?"

Maya remembers. Elena with her nervous laugh, her slow typing, her three kids waiting at home.

"I remember."

"You helped her. And they let her go anyway. And you stayed."

It isn't an accusation. It's a statement of fact. Maya stayed because she was faster. Younger. Better at the systems that were replacing them. She benefited from Elena's departure—one less person competing for fewer spots.

"Yes," Maya says. "I stayed."

"So why are you doing this now?"

It's the question Maya has been asking herself. The answer, when it comes, is simpler than she expected.

"Because I don't want to be the last one left. Sitting at my desk while everyone else's chair is empty, pretending that means I won."

Carmen is quiet for a long moment. The light through the window shifts. A clock ticks somewhere.

"Where do I sign?"

---

They file the petition on a Friday.

Eight signatures. The bare minimum for a majority of thirteen. Maya watches the email go to the NLRB, cc'd to firm management. It feels like dropping a stone down a well.

The splash comes at 4 PM. David Reese requests a meeting with "all support staff."

At 9 PM, her phone buzzes. HR.

"We'd like you to come in tomorrow. 10 AM. Just a quick conversation."

She doesn't sleep.

---

The HR office is cold. The HR director is a man named Thompson with a firm handshake and a framed photo of a sailboat on his wall.

"Maya. Thanks for coming in."

"I didn't have much choice."

He smiles. "I'll get to the point. The firm is aware that you've been organizing your colleagues. This is your legal right. We can't stop you."

"But?"

"But we want to offer an alternative." He slides a folder across the desk. "An enhanced transition package. Twelve months' salary. Full benefits through next year. Strong references. Career counseling with a firm that specializes in legal placement."

Maya looks at the folder. She doesn't touch it.

"And if I don't take it?"

Thompson's smile doesn't waver. "Then we proceed with the election. But I should tell you—our legal team is confident the vote will fail. And once it does..." He spreads his hands. "The firm will need to consider whether employees who've proven disruptive are the right fit going forward."

"You're threatening to fire me."

"I'm giving you information. What you do with it is your choice."

Maya stands. Her legs feel strange—like they belong to someone else, someone who chose to walk into this office and might choose to walk out.

"I need to think about it."

"Take the weekend." Thompson stands too. "But Maya—think about your daughter. About what's best for her."

She walks out. She doesn't shake his hand.

---

That night, she tells Lily.

She sits her down at the kitchen table—the same table where she's been making lists and notes for weeks. She explains about the AI, the layoffs, the organizing. What she did, what might happen.

Lily listens. She's sixteen, not a child. But she's still young enough that her mother's job has always been background—the thing that pays for the house, the wifi, the life.

"So they're trying to make you quit," Lily says.

"They're giving me a way out. Without having to fight."

"And you're thinking about taking it?"

Maya looks at her daughter. Dark eyes, serious, always watching.

"I'm thinking about what's best for us," Maya says.

"What do you *want* to do?"

The question stops her.

She's been thinking about what she should do—what's smart, what's safe, what a responsible mother would choose. She hasn't asked herself what she wants.

"I don't know," she says.

"I think you do."

Lily waits. The kitchen is warm. The window is dark.

Maya thinks about the empty desks. About Carmen's mug from 2015. About Derek, who took the package and is probably right now applying for jobs that don't exist. About Elena, who she trained and watched leave. About all the people who kept their heads down and lost their jobs anyway.

She thinks about Lily, watching her right now. Learning something about what you do when you're scared.

"I want to fight," Maya says. The words come out rough, surprising her. "I want to see this through."

Lily nods slowly. "Then do it."

"It might not work. We might lose everything."

"We might." Lily picks at the edge of the table. "But if you take the money and walk away—in ten years, will you be okay with that?"

Maya already knows the answer. She's known it since the moment she opened her mouth in that conference room and couldn't close it.

"No," she says. "I won't."

"Then I guess you know what to do."

---

Monday morning. 9 AM. The conference room.

David Reese stands at the head of the table again. This time there are lawyers—the firm's lawyers—explaining the "election process." Words like "mutual respect" and "open dialogue" and "everyone's best interests."

Maya sits in the back. She doesn't speak. She doesn't need to.

The vote is scheduled for three weeks out—expedited, the NLRB representative explains, given the clear circumstances. Secret ballot. Twelve remaining paralegals will choose.

---

The three weeks are the longest of Maya's life.

Management launches a campaign. Emails about "the firm's commitment to our team." Meetings about "the risks of third-party representation." Karen takes people to lunch, one by one, returning with their doubts in her pocket.

Maya and Priya counter as best they can. They talk about what they're actually fighting for: severance floors so no one leaves with nothing. Retraining funds that aren't a joke. Seniority protections for who stays and who goes. A seat at the table when the decisions are made.

But they're outgunned—two women with no budget against a firm with lawyers and HR and the quiet threat of termination.

On Tuesday of the second week, Angela takes the enhanced package. Down to eleven. They need six to win.

They have six confirmed yeses. Anyone could change their mind.

Maya wakes at 3 AM to the sound of her own heartbeat, loud in the dark room. She dreams of the notification chime, but when she wakes there's only silence. She makes coffee. She watches the sun come up. She goes to work and pretends everything is normal.

---

The vote is on a Thursday.

The ballots are paper—old-fashioned, anonymous. One by one, Maya's colleagues step into the small room where the NLRB observer waits. One by one, they make their choice.

Maya votes yes. Of course she votes yes. Then she returns to her desk and waits.

The count takes twenty minutes. Twenty minutes of staring at documents she can't read, of the notification chime sounding and meaning nothing, of watching the clock in the corner of her screen.

At 3:47 PM, the NLRB observer announces the results.

Eight yes. Three no.

They won.

---

For a moment—just a moment—Maya doesn't believe it.

Then Priya grabs her arm, and the grip is real, and Maya's chest does something strange: it opens. The pressure she's been carrying for weeks releases all at once.

They won.

She laughs. It comes out wrong, too loud, almost a sob. Priya is hugging her. Someone is crying—James, maybe. Carmen nods from across the room, a small smile on her face, and Maya feels tears on her own cheeks without knowing when they started.

They won.

But the moment passes. It has to pass.

Because three people voted no—three colleagues who have to keep working beside them, knowing they know. Management hasn't changed. David Reese is still in his corner office. The lawyers are still on retainer. The AI is still processing documents faster than any human ever could.

The jobs that are gone are still gone. Derek isn't coming back. The ghost desks are still empty.

And now comes the hard part: negotiating with a management that didn't want them to exist. Fighting for severance floors that matter. Retraining that leads somewhere. Seniority protections that aren't just words on paper.

They won the right to fight. That's all.

---

Maya walks back to her desk. The notification chime sounds—the AI has completed another batch. She sits down, logs in, opens the first document.

The same work. The same screen. The same hum of the HVAC.

But when she looks up, she sees Priya two desks over, sees Carmen by the window, sees the colleagues who chose to stand together. She sees them, and they see her.

The chime sounds again. There's work to do. There's always work to do.

Maya opens the document. She starts to read.

Outside, the city goes on. Inside, something has changed.

It's not a victory. Not yet. Maybe not ever. But it's a start.

She gets to work.

---

*End*
