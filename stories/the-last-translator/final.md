# The Last Translator

**by Mira Claudine Voss**

---

*Yuèguāng chéndiàn.*

Atlas had translated it as "the moonlight settles." Elena deleted "settles" and typed "silts." The screen pulsed blue—that soft rewarding glow she'd come to hate. Somewhere in a data center, her correction joined thousands of others, training the system that was slowly making her obsolete.

*Corrections logged: 47. Alignment contribution: 0.003%.*

She closed the laptop. Her eyes were dry, her lower back stiff from sitting too long. The apartment was quiet. Marcus was still at work—a charrette, the third this month, his firm competing for a project they probably wouldn't get. She could hear the refrigerator humming, the occasional car passing on the street below. The ordinary sounds of a world that kept moving whether or not anyone was paying attention.

She stood, stretched, and walked to her other desk.

This one was older, scarred oak that had belonged to her grandmother. No computer. Just paper. Zhou Lianke's handwritten pages spread across the surface, held down by a glass paperweight she'd bought in Beijing fifteen years ago, the year she first read him.

She remembered that day exactly. A cramped used bookstore near Beida, rain on the window, the musty smell of old paper. She'd picked up *Cold Garden* at random—a slim volume, ugly cover, no author photo. Opened to a page in the middle and read:

*My father's hands knew the names of things before he did. His fingers spelled out a word I couldn't read—soil, maybe, or sorrow. The same characters, in his script.*

She'd bought the book. Read it that night in her hotel room, then again the next morning, then started translating the first poem before she'd even finished her coffee. Zhou wrote in a voice that felt like a secret—intimate, strange, operating on frequencies that standard Mandarin didn't quite cover. She'd spent the next decade learning to hear him.

Now his final manuscript lay before her: four notebooks and a bundle of loose sheets that had arrived two years after his death, sent by his daughter in Shanghai. Seventy-seven poems, written in the final year of his life, when his mind was already beginning to blur.

She opened the third notebook to poem 34.

She'd been working on this one all week. Not stuck exactly—she'd drafted the first three stanzas—but the poem was resisting her. Something in the rhythm wasn't landing. The Mandarin flowed like water, but her English kept pooling in the wrong places.

*Try the third line differently.*

She crossed out "remembering" and wrote "recalling." Then crossed that out and wrote "holding." Better. The image was of a woman standing in a winter garden, watching her own breath. Zhou's widow, probably—he wrote about her often, especially near the end.

*She stood holding the shape of her last exhalation—*

Yes. That was the rhythm. She felt the small click of rightness that meant she was close.

Her phone buzzed. Sophie.

"Tell me you're eating dinner," Sophie said when Elena answered.

"I ate lunch."

"Elena."

"What time is it?"

"Eight-thirty."

Elena looked at the window. Dark. She hadn't noticed.

"I'm calling because I heard something," Sophie said. "Meridian is cutting their retainer list."

Elena's publisher. One of the last houses that still employed human translators for literary work. "Cutting how much?"

"Eight down to three. Full-time reviewers only. Everyone else is project-by-project."

"When?"

"End of the quarter."

Two months. "Who told you?"

"Daniel Kim. He's on their board now."

She remembered Daniel—he'd been an acquiring editor years ago, back when publishers still acquired books in languages other than English. He'd taken a chance on Zhou's second collection. Now he was on boards, making decisions about efficiency targets. The same trajectory as everyone else who'd survived.

"Are you going to be one of the three?" Sophie asked.

"I don't know."

"You should call them. Remind them you exist."

"I exist. They know."

After Sophie hung up, Elena sat in the silence. She looked at poem 34, at the line she'd just fixed. The small victory felt very small.

Twenty-two years. She'd been translating professionally for twenty-two years. She'd translated Nobel laureates, Booker winners, writers whose names people actually recognized. She'd spent decades learning to inhabit other voices, to think in the space between languages, to find the English that lived inside the Chinese like a figure waiting in marble.

Now she spent most of her days correcting a machine.

The Meridian offices were in a building that used to feel busy. Elena remembered the elevator crowded with editorial assistants, the open floor buzzing with phone calls and keyboard clicks. That was five years ago. Maybe six.

Now the elevator was empty, and the floor was quiet. Twenty desks, four people. The humans who remained were there for "oversight"—attending meetings, performing the irreducible tasks that still required a face.

"Elena." David Park waved her into a glass-walled conference room. He was Meridian's head of production now, which meant something different than it used to. "Thanks for coming in."

She sat. The room was cold, aggressively air-conditioned. David had a tablet in front of him, graphs on the screen—lines trending upward.

"So," he said. "Good news and context."

"Context first."

"The latest benchmarks. Readers can't distinguish Atlas translations from human in double-blind tests anymore. On most literary texts, anyway."

"I've seen."

"That's—it's remarkable, honestly." He shifted in his chair. "The good news is you're one of our best reviewers. Your feedback is high-quality, and the model learns faster from your inputs than almost anyone else."

There it was. The compliment that was also a confession. She was the meal that kept thanking the restaurant.

"So I'm on the retainer?"

"For now. Smaller team, project-based contracts for most people. We'll prioritize you for the prestige work."

"When there is prestige work."

"When there is." He looked genuinely uncomfortable, which was something. "You're good at this, Elena. I wish that mattered more."

She stood. "Thanks for the context, David."

Marcus was home when she got back. He was in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove—tomato sauce, from the smell, garlic and basil. She remembered the first meal he'd ever cooked for her: the same sauce, the same apron, a different apartment. Nineteen years ago. They'd been married for seventeen of them, and she still liked watching him cook.

"Early night?" she asked.

"The render crashed again. Figured I'd be more useful here." He kissed her cheek. "How was the meeting?"

"Instructive."

She sat at the kitchen island and told him. The restructuring, the benchmarks, the shrinking retainer list. He listened the way he always listened—attentive, trying to understand, not quite getting it.

"So you're still employed," he said.

"For now. If there are projects."

"That's not nothing."

"It's not nothing."

He stirred the sauce. On the counter, his tablet was open to architectural plans—a renovation, all clean lines and sustainable materials. He still did that work the old way, mostly. Sketching by hand, thinking in space. AI tools helped with the technical drawings, the compliance checks. But the vision was still his. For now.

"Maybe you could consult," he said. "Train other translators. You have all that expertise—"

"I want to translate."

He turned off the burner. "I know. I'm just trying to—"

"I know." She reached for his hand. "I know you are."

They ate in front of the television, some nature documentary about Arctic foxes. She picked at her pasta and thought about Zhou. About poem 34. About the woman in the winter garden, watching her breath.

After dinner, Marcus fell asleep on the couch. She covered him with a blanket, kissed his forehead, and went to her study.

The discovery happened at 11:47 PM, and it was an accident.

She'd been running translations through Atlas—routine review work, a novel she didn't care about. The prose was flat, serviceable. Atlas rendered it adequately. She made a few corrections, watched the screen pulse blue, tried not to think about what she was feeding.

Then she reached a passage that made her stop.

The novel's narrator was describing his grandfather's hands. The Chinese was ordinary, even clichéd. But the English translation was strange—strange in a way she recognized. The sentence had an unusual rhythm, a tendency to pause in unexpected places. The metaphor extended just slightly too far before landing.

It sounded like Zhou.

It sounded like *her* translation of Zhou.

She felt cold. She ran another passage through—this time deliberately, choosing something emotional, something that required nuance. The English that came back had the same quality. That particular balance of image and restraint. That rhythm she'd developed over a decade of translating one specific voice.

She'd known, intellectually, that her published translations were in the training data. Everyone's were. But knowing it and *seeing* it were different things. The system hadn't just learned from her corrections. It had absorbed her entire body of work—every choice she'd made, every rhythm she'd developed, every voice she'd inhabited. And now it was using those voices for everything else.

Atlas hadn't just learned Zhou. It had learned her.

She closed the laptop. Pressed her palms against her eyes until she saw colors. Her throat was tight. Something had cracked open in her chest—a fissure she'd been pretending wasn't there.

When she opened her eyes, she looked at Zhou's manuscript. Poem 34. The woman in the winter garden.

*If I finish this,* she thought, *if I publish it, they'll train on that too. Every word I write teaches them.*

*If I don't finish, nobody will. It dies with me.*

She sat there for a long time, in the dark, thinking about endings.

---

Three days later, at 3 AM, she was still working on poem 34.

She'd fixed the rhythm problem in the first stanzas. But now she was stuck on something else: a word in the fourth line that she couldn't read. Zhou's handwriting had been shaking here. The ink had pooled and blotted. What remained was a smudge that could be *qīng* (green, or clear) or *qíng* (feeling) or *qìng* (to celebrate) or something else entirely.

She'd tried them all. None of them worked.

She picked up the magnifying glass she'd bought specifically for Zhou's manuscripts. Angled the desk lamp. Peered at the smudge from every direction.

And then she saw it.

It wasn't a smudge. It wasn't an error. It was two characters, deliberately merged. Zhou had invented a word.

The top half was *qīng*—blue-green, the color of celadon, of old jade. The bottom half was *wàng*—to forget, to lose. He'd combined them, stacked vertically in a way that no standard character set would recognize. A neologism. A word that existed only in this poem, only in his shaking hand.

The forgetting of color. The memory of a color that no longer exists.

Elena laughed out loud—a raw, startled sound, almost a sob. Of course. Of course Zhou had done this. In his final year, with his mind slipping away, he'd invented language. Made new words because the old ones weren't enough.

This was the work. Not correcting, not reviewing—*this*. The leap that couldn't be pattern-matched. The human act of making something from nothing.

She reached for her pen.

What was the English? There was no English. She had to make one.

She thought about jade and forgetting. Colors that fade. The feeling of reaching for a word and finding only space.

She wrote: *jadegone.*

One word. An English neologism, born to meet a Chinese one across the gap of language and time. Her word, for Zhou's word. Two translators making something together—one alive, one dead, both still working.

She looked at the line. The poem clicked into place around it.

She wrote the rest of poem 34.

---

The next months passed in a blur. Poems 35, 36, 37. Each one a puzzle, each one a gift. Some were easier—Zhou's handwriting clearer, his mind sharper. Some were harder—more neologisms, more ambiguity, more of that late-period strangeness that only she understood.

She worked early mornings and late nights, in the margins around her correction work. The blue glow no longer bothered her. She let it pulse and pulse. She was feeding the machine, yes, but she was also doing something else—something the machine couldn't touch.

Marcus brought her coffee and didn't ask questions. He'd seen her like this before, years ago, when she was translating Zhou's third collection. The same absorption, the same late nights, the same silence that was full of words. He understood, in his way. He left her to it.

The retainer ended. Then the project contracts dried up. She got the polite email about "strategic realignment" and "valued partnerships." She was officially unemployed now, if you counted the way the world counted.

She didn't count.

Sophie called to say that the last major publisher had stopped hiring human literary translators entirely. "What are you going to do?"

"Finish the poems."

"And then?"

"I don't know yet."

"You sound calm."

"I am calm."

"That's weird."

"Maybe."

---

Poem 77 was the last one.

It was short—only eight lines, written on a scrap of paper torn from a notebook. Zhou's handwriting was almost illegible here, the characters compressed and shaky, as if he was trying to get everything down before it disappeared.

Elena read it slowly, character by character. Some she had to guess. Some she had to invent meanings for.

The poem was about forgetting. Zhou knew, at the end, that he was losing language. The words were slipping away like fish through a net. And he'd written this—a poem about reaching for a name and finding only space.

She translated it:

*The names of things depart before the things themselves.*
*First, the word for river. Then the word for stone.*
*I wake not knowing what to call the window's light.*
*I sit. The shape remains. The name is gone.*
*So this is how the world empties—*
*not of objects but of their handles,*
*the sounds that let us grip and carry them.*
*I have forgotten how to say forget.*

She put down her pen. Read it again. Changed one word, then changed it back.

It was good. It was Zhou's. It was hers.

---

Later that night, she opened her email.

The manuscript was finished. Seventy-seven poems, translated. More than a year's work. A voice carried across language and death.

She could submit it to publishers. Someone would take it—Zhou Lianke's final work, translated by his only English interpreter. A prestige object, small audience, tiny print run.

And then Atlas would learn from it. Her words, her inventions—all fed into the system, teaching the machine how to sound like Zhou, how to sound like her.

She could keep it private. Let it sit on her hard drive, unread. Let it die with her.

She thought about Zhou. He'd been a recluse, suspicious of fame. But he'd kept writing, even when his mind was failing. He'd made new words for things that had no names. He hadn't written for posterity. He'd written because that's what he did.

She opened a new email.

In the *To* field, she typed Sophie's address. Then Marcus's. Then, after a pause, the address she'd found in Zhou's papers: his daughter, Li-Xia, in Shanghai. They'd exchanged only formal emails about the manuscript. Elena didn't know if Li-Xia even read English well.

She attached the file.

*Dear Sophie, Marcus, and Li-Xia,*

*This is the finished manuscript. I don't know what happens next. But I wanted you to have it.*

*-E*

She pressed send.

Not zero, not infinite. Human scale.

---

A month later, Elena was at her oak desk again.

On it was a new manuscript—not Zhou, but a young poet named Wei Lin. Twenty-six years old, publishing her first chapbook with a tiny press in Taipei. Nobody had heard of her. Nothing she'd written was in any training data.

The poems were about bodies: illness, desire, the strange fact of having physical form. Wei Lin's handwriting was clear and confident. Her voice was nothing like Zhou's—faster, sharper, more interested in surfaces than depths.

Elena opened the first poem. Read the first line:

*我的身体是一封没有收件人的信。*

*My body is a letter with no addressee.*

She felt the familiar vertigo of starting something new—stepping into a voice that wasn't hers, finding the English that lived inside the Chinese.

She liked Wei Lin.

She picked up her pen.

Her handwriting had never been great. But it was hers. And there was work to do.

She wrote the first line. Then the second.

Outside, the sun was coming up.
