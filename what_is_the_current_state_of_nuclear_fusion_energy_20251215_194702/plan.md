# Research Plan: Nuclear Fusion Energy Research (2024-2025)

## Topic Interpretation

### Core Focus
This research examines the current state of nuclear fusion energy development, focusing on the period from 2024-2025. Nuclear fusion—the process of combining light atomic nuclei to release energy (the same process powering the sun)—has been pursued as a potential clean energy source for decades. Recent breakthroughs have accelerated interest and investment in this field.

### Scope Assumptions
1. **Geographic Scope**: Global perspective, covering major projects in the US, EU, China, UK, Japan, South Korea, and private sector worldwide
2. **Temporal Focus**: Primary focus on developments from late 2023 through 2025, with historical context where relevant
3. **Technical Scope**: Coverage of major fusion approaches including:
   - Magnetic confinement (tokamaks, stellarators)
   - Inertial confinement (laser fusion)
   - Alternative/compact approaches (field-reversed configurations, magnetized target fusion)
4. **Stakeholder Scope**: Government programs, private companies, research institutions, and international collaborations
5. **Exclusions**: This research will not deeply cover cold fusion claims or theoretical physics beyond what's relevant to practical energy production

### Key Definitions
- **Net Energy Gain (Q>1)**: More energy produced than consumed to initiate fusion
- **Ignition**: Self-sustaining fusion reaction
- **Commercial Viability**: Ability to produce electricity at competitive costs
- **First Plasma**: Initial achievement of plasma in a new fusion device
