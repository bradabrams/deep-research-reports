- Established methodology and output structure
- Ready to begin research phase

### December 16, 2024 - Research Iteration 1
- Completed comprehensive web searches on key topics
- Gathered 20 sources from institutional, government, academic, and industry publications
- Verified 28 claims with confidence ratings (24 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM)

## Key Findings Summary

### Major Breakthroughs 2024-2025
1. **NIF Ignition Progress**: 5.2 MJ output (Feb 2024), 8.6 MJ (April 2025)
2. **WEST Record**: 20+ minutes plasma maintenance
3. **WHAM**: 17 Tesla magnetic field record
4. **China HL-3**: 1 million amperes in H-mode

### Project Status Updates
- **ITER**: Delayed to 2033 first plasma, 2039 D-T ops; €18-20B total cost
- **SPARC**: Assembly started 2025, first plasma 2026, Q>1 target 2027
- **ARC Plant**: Announced for Virginia, 400 MW, early 2030s
- **Helion Orion**: 50 MW reactor under construction in Washington

### Investment Landscape
- Total private investment: >$9.7 billion globally
- CFS: ~$3 billion raised (1/3 of all private fusion investment)
- TAE: $1.2 billion raised, ~$5 billion valuation
- UK: £2.5 billion committed over 5 years
- China: ~$1.5 billion/year (double US government budget)

### Regulatory Developments
- NRC ADVANCE Act 2024: Fusion regulated as byproduct material, not fission
- Proposed rule publication: May 28, 2025
- Framework designed to be technology-neutral and scalable

### Power Purchase Agreements
- Google → CFS: 200 MW from ARC
- Microsoft → Helion: PPA signed

## Running Questions (Updated)
- [x] Has NIF achieved repeatable ignition? YES - 5 successful shots since Dec 2022
- [x] What is ITER's current projected first plasma date? 2033 (delayed from 2025)
- [x] Total private investment in fusion to date? ~$9.7-10 billion
- [x] Which companies claim earliest commercial timeline? CFS (early 2030s)

## Areas for Further Research
- [ ] Detailed technical comparison of different fusion approaches
- [ ] Workforce and supply chain constraints
- [ ] Environmental impact assessments
- [ ] Grid integration challenges
- [ ] Comparison with other clean energy sources (LCOE)
- [ ] Skeptical perspectives and critical analysis

## Key Sources Identified
1. IAEA - World Fusion Outlook 2024, Six Trends for 2025
2. Physics World / Max Planck - ITER delay analysis
3. LLNL - NIF achievements and records
4. MIT News - CFS/SPARC/ARC announcements
5. Fusion Industry Association - Industry data
6. NRC - Regulatory framework developments

## Preliminary Observations
- Clear acceleration in private sector activity vs. government projects
- ITER delays creating opportunity for private companies to demonstrate first
- China emerging as significant fusion power with large budget and rapid progress
- Regulatory clarity in US (NRC) enabling commercial pathway
- High-temperature superconducting magnets proving transformative
- Major tech companies (Google, Microsoft) making early power commitments
- Gap between scientific ignition and commercial viability still substantial
