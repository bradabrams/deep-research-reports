# Research Notes: Nuclear Fusion Energy (2024-2025)

## Session Log

### December 15, 2024
- Created research plan with 20 research questions
- Identified visual needs (12 items)
- Established methodology and output structure
- Ready to begin research phase

## Key Areas to Investigate
- [ ] NIF ignition follow-up experiments
- [ ] ITER construction status and timeline updates
- [ ] Private fusion company funding rounds (2024)
- [ ] Regulatory developments (especially US NRC)
- [ ] China's fusion program advances
- [ ] SPARC/ARC progress from Commonwealth Fusion Systems
- [ ] Helion's milestones and Microsoft deal
- [ ] JT-60SA and other international tokamaks
- [ ] AI/ML applications in plasma control

## Running Questions
- Has NIF achieved repeatable ignition?
- What is ITER's current projected first plasma date?
- Total private investment in fusion to date?
- Which companies claim earliest commercial timeline?

## Preliminary Observations
(To be filled during research)
