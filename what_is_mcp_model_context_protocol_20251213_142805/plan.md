# Research Plan: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Topic Interpretation

**Subject**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) - An open protocol developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to connect with external data sources, tools, and services in a standardized way.

**Assumptions Made**:
- The research focuses on Anthropic's MCP, not other protocols with similar acronyms
- The protocol was announced in late 2024 and is still relatively new
- Interest spans both technical implementation and broader ecosystem implications
- The audience includes developers, business stakeholders, and AI industry observers
